# mvmouse - move the mouse pointer to prevent te screensaver to lock the screen

Start this script in a separate window. 

The default update time is 60 seconds. Afterwards a random generated value is added to the current location of the mouse cursor and the mouse pointer gets moved to the new location.
To make this auto-movement less obvious a random value gets added/subtracted to the refresh timer.
