# mvmouse - Auto-move the mouse pointer to prevent the screensaver locking the screen

Start this script in a separate window. The mouse-pointer will periodically moved but you can continue working. 

The default update time is 60 seconds. <BR>
Afterwards a random generated value is added to the current location of the mouse cursor and the mouse pointer gets moved to the new location. <BR>
To make this auto-movement less obvious a random value gets added/subtracted to the refresh timer.
